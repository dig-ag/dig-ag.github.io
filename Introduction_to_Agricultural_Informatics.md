A Course in Progress: This course is currently being developed as it is offered for the second time. Relevant changes to this course will be posted to this Github repository. New materials will be shared here each week. Major updates will be announced in class and/or via email/Slack.


A Brief Overview:
We will overview current and emerging technologies used in digital agriculture. You will be engaged in learning technology fundamentals (languages, concepts, methods), through seven 2-week projects. These hands-on exercises will allow you to gain a practical understanding of the technology itself, review research and development trends, and debate opportunities and challenges presented by each technology. This course will equip you with basic computational thinking and software development skills for Agricultural Informatics careers.
